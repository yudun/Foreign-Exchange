For the resulting data matrix, I choose the directionality of bid price for EURUSD in 10 minutes later as the label, and the directionality of bid price for all other available currency as features.

The reason for my choice is that it will be an interesting model if we can 
use the trend of the directionality of bid price for other price to predict
the directionality of the bid for EURUSD in the next several minutes. And I
believe the changing of the bid for different currency are somewhat related.

To derive such a matrix, I align all the raw data to the same timestep (1 minute), 
and label the directionality of the bid for each record by observing the bid price 
for each adjacent records.
