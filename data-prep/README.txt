There are 3 files in total for processing the original Financial to a data matrix.

They should be executed one by one in this order to get the correct result:
1. smallSampleGenerator.py
2. timeWindowGenerator.py
3. timeWindowCombiner.py


The first program generates small sample data, which is a small subset
of the original data, to help me test my other 2 files.

The second one help align each input raw data file to a time window and calculate the
directionality of bid price for each currency. I also make some interpolation here
whenever a necessary timestamp is missed

The third file combine all the aligned data together to generate a data matrix,
where we use the directionality of all currency except for EURUSD as features (14 features in total), 
and we use EURUSDâ€™s directionality 10 minutes later as the label.

Format:
TIME	AUDJPY	AUDNZD	AUDUSD	CADJPY	CHFJPY	EURCHF	EURGBP	EURJPY	GBPJPY	GBPUSD	NZDUSD	USDCAD	USDCHF	USDJPY	EURUSD(label)

Sample of the result matrix looks like following:
