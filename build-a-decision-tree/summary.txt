My decision tree is trained by 24198 instantces from Jan.2015.
The maximum depth is 14 (we use 14 features).

After testing on 6050 test Set, it results in an accuracy of 83.77%.
But it doesn't mean that it is a very good model, because some statistics on my
traning data shows that the percentage of label value 1 in training set is 80.65%,
So even if we make a prediction as all the label to be 1, we can gain a accuracy as 
high as 80%.

My observation indicates that most of the leaves are labeled with 1, which is easy to understand,
due to the high percentage of 1 in my training set.



So in general, this model gain improvement from a blind "all-1-prediction" by 
(83.77 - 80.65) ~ 3%, which is a tiny improvement which indicate following possibilities:

1. The relationship between the directionality 10 minutes later with all the directionality
of other currency is not very strong, may be we should try other features or tune the "future step";

2. The training set should be larger, which may result in a more significant performance.
